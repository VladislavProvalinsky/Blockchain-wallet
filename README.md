# About project

Blockchain: electronic wallet and mining service (Study project in IT-Academy (Belarus Hi Tech Park). 
Electronic wallet - Spring MVC web interface for managing transactions and initiating a mining session. 
Mining service - Spring Boot application generating blocks for mining sessions on a multithreading basis and verifying the consistency of the chain.
Database - MySQL, encryptor - Bitcoinj/BouncyCastle, testing - JMeter.

#Configuration details

After cloning project on your PC you must do some configuration details (step by step):
1) Go to the _application.properties_ file in both modules and setup (#MySQL connection properties) for your development environment.
2) In blockchain module _application.properties_ file setup (hibernate.ddl-auto=create) to say hibernate build DB automatically first time. Then change it for _"update"_ or _"none"_.
3) In blockchain module _application.properties_ file edit (#Files Upload) property. Put the path sutible for your operating system.
4) If ne—Åessary edit **hibernate.dialect** and **timezone** properties in both modules _application.properties_ files (# Hibernate).
5) Make clean-install Maven lifecycle in both modules and ensure that everything is Ok.
6) Run both modules.

#How to use

Go to the home page http://localhost:8080/blockchain/ and you will be redirected to the HTTPS connection. Ignore the browser blocking and continue connection (system uses SSL).
You will pass to the https://localhost:8443/blockchain/ start page.
Register new wallet. After succesfull passing registration system will generate on your PC desctop new directory with Private-Key txt file in it. This key is your digital signature for every wallet operations. Keep it secured and unmodified because without right Private-Key verification mechanism will abort all your transactions and you will lost all your money!

#How to use Mining Engine

For each user, the system provides the opportunity to use its own Mining Engine for bitcoin mining. The main tasks performed by the mining mechanism, which is under the control 
of users, are the verification of unconfirmed transactions of the system and the verification of their digital signature and hash values, as well as the generation of new blocks 
in the blockchain system with the calculation of the unique key value using a hash algorithm. You can independently operate your mining process by activating or stopping it by 
pressing the appropriate buttons.
By default, regardless of the users, the system checks the integrity of the block tree for hacker attacks in order to replace the values in the blocks. If a mismatch is detected 
in the blockchain chain, the system crashes its process and displays the message which block has been changed.

#Summary

This is my first open source training project, ready for something more.
